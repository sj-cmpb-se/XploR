Title: Large-Scale Allele-Specific CNV Detection Using Coverage and Allelic Imbalance in WES data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Meiling Jin
Maintainer: Meiling Jin <mjin47@stjude.org>
Description: Detects large-scale, allele-specific copy number variations (CNVs) from
    tumor-only sequencing data.
    Leverages both coverage depth and allelic imbalance information to infer
    genome-wide copy number states and allelic configurations. Designed for
    whole-exome sequencing.
    Suitable for detecting aneuploidy, large deletions or gains, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in cancer genomics applications.
