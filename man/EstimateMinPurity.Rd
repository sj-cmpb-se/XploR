\title{Estimate Minimum Tumor Purity from MAF Data}
\usage{
EstimateMinPurity(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing at least the columns \code{MAF} and \code{Tag}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The estimated minimum tumor purity, or 0 if no suitable segments are found.
}
\description{
Estimates the minimum tumor purity based on the lowest MAF among segments tagged as "Include".
}
\details{
Only rows with \code{Tag == "Include"} are considered. If the minimum MAF is less than 0.4, the minimum purity is estimated as \code{max((0.5 - min\_MAF) / 0.5 - 0.05, 0)}. Otherwise, returns 0.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(MAF = c(0.3, 0.45, 0.5), Tag = c("Include", "Exclude", "Include"))
EstimateMinPurity(df)

}
