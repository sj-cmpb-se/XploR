\title{Convert Segment Mean to Original Coverage}
\usage{
SegmentMeanToOriCov(SM, gender, chromosome, diploid_cov)
}
\arguments{
\item{SM}{Numeric. The segment mean (log2 ratio) from CNV analysis.}

\item{gender}{Character. Sample gender, either \code{"male"} or \code{"female"}.}

\item{chromosome}{Character or factor. Chromosome name (e.g., "1", "2", ..., "X", "Y").}

\item{diploid_cov}{Numeric. The expected coverage for a diploid region (e.g., 100).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The estimated original coverage for the segment.
}
\description{
Calculates the original coverage for a segment based on its segment mean (log2 ratio), gender, chromosome, and assumed diploid coverage.
}
\details{
For males and sex chromosomes (\code{"X"} or \code{"Y"}), the diploid coverage is halved.
For all other cases, the segment mean is scaled by the full diploid coverage.
}
\examples{
SegmentMeanToOriCov(SM = 0, gender = "male", chromosome = "X", diploid_cov = 100)
SegmentMeanToOriCov(SM = 0.5, gender = "female", chromosome = "3", diploid_cov = 100)

}
