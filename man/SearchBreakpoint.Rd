\title{Search for Breakpoints within a Segment Using MAF Data}
\usage{
SearchBreakpoint(seg_row, maf, mergeai, snpmin, minaisize, aibinsize)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing a single segment. Must have columns: Sample, Chromosome, Start, End, Num_Probes, Segment_Mean, Segment_Mean_raw, Count, Baseline_cov, gatk_gender, pipeline_gender, size.}

\item{maf}{A data frame or tibble containing MAF data. Must include columns: Chromosome, Start, End, maf.}

\item{mergeai}{Numeric. Threshold for the difference in MAF (gmm_mean) between adjacent segments to allow merging.}

\item{snpmin}{Numeric. Minimum SNP count required for a segment to be considered as a separate segment.}

\item{minaisize}{Numeric, smallest AI segment size (default: 1000000).}

\item{aibinsize}{Numeric, AI bin size (default: 500000).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the refined segment(s), including updated breakpoints, MAF metrics, and a \code{BreakpointSource} column indicating whether breakpoints were post-processed or from GATK.
}
\description{
Refines breakpoints within a segment using MAF data.
If enough informative MAF sites are present, the segment may be split into finer regions based on MAF clustering and merging.
