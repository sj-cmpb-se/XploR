\title{Search for Breakpoints within a Segment Using BAF Data}
\usage{
SearchBreakpoint(seg_row, baf, opt)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing a single segment. Must have columns: Sample, Chromosome, Start, End, Num_Probes, Segment_Mean, Segment_Mean_raw, Count, Baseline_cov, gatk_gender, pipeline_gender, size.}

\item{baf}{A data frame or tibble containing BAF data. Must include columns: Chromosome, Start, End, baf.}

\item{opt}{A list of options. Must include \code{aibinsize} (bin size for AI), \code{snpmin} (minimum SNP count), and \code{minaisize} (minimum AI size).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the refined segment(s), including updated breakpoints, BAF metrics, and a \code{BreakpointSource} column indicating whether breakpoints were post-processed or from GATK.
}
\description{
Refines breakpoints within a segment using B-allele frequency (BAF) data and AI binning/merging procedures.
If enough informative BAF sites are present, the segment may be split into finer regions based on BAF clustering and merging.
