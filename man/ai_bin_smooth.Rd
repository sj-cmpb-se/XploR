\title{Smooth AI Bin Values by Downsampling to Mode Proportions}
\usage{
ai_bin_smooth(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric or character vector. Typically a vector of rounded AI (e.g., BAF) values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector, either unchanged (if length <= 30) or of length <= 30, with values sampled according to observed frequencies.
}
\description{
If the length of the input vector is greater than 30, returns a vector of up to 30 values sampled according to the observed frequency of each unique value (mode smoothing). Otherwise, returns the vector unchanged.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
x <- sample(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), 100, replace = TRUE)
ai_bin_smooth(x)
