\title{Generate Whitelist, Blacklist, and Cytoband-Detectable Edge Files from GATK PoN HDF5}
\usage{
PonProcess(
  pon_file,
  blacklist_bed,
  whitelist_bed,
  cytoband,
  detectable_edge,
  gender
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pon_file}{Character. Path to the GATK PoN HDF5 file.}

\item{blacklist_bed}{Character. Output file path for the blacklist BED file (intervals excluded from the panel).}

\item{whitelist_bed}{Character. Output file path for the whitelist BED file (final intervals retained in the panel).}

\item{cytoband}{Character. Path to the cytoband annotation file with columns: chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, name, gieStain.}

\item{detectable_edge}{Character. Output file path for the cytoband-detectable edge file, used in downstream annotation.}

\item{gender}{Character. female or male. Gender of the GATK PON file. Mixed gender are not supported.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing data frames: \code{blacklist}, \code{whitelist}, and \code{cytoband_edge}.
}
\description{
Processes a GATK Panel of Normals (PoN) HDF5 file to extract final intervals (whitelist) and excluded regions (blacklist), and outputs them as BED files. Also creates a cytoband-detectable edge file by overlapping whitelist intervals with cytoband annotations to define p and q arm coverage.
}
\details{
This function calls \code{\link{FindCytoband}}, which must be available in the package namespace.

This function performs the following:
\itemize{
\item Reads original and final intervals from the PoN file and maps contig indices to chromosome names.
\item Writes a whitelist BED file with intervals retained for CNV calling.
\item Writes a blacklist BED file with intervals filtered out by GATK PoN processing.
\item Generates a cytoband-detectable edge file by intersecting whitelist intervals with cytoband annotations, summarizing detectable p and q arm boundaries per chromosome.
