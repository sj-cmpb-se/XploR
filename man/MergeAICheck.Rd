\usage{
MergeAICheck(cur_row, next_row, opt)
}
\arguments{
\item{cur_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing the current segment.}

\item{next_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing the next segment.}

\item{opt}{A list of options, must include \code{mergeai} (numeric threshold for mean difference) and \code{snpmin} (minimum SNP count).}
}
\value{
Logical value: \code{TRUE} if the two segments should be merged, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
