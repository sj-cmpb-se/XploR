\title{Check Whether Two AI Segments Should Be Merged}
\usage{
MergeAICheck(cur_row, next_row, mergeai, snpmin)
}
\arguments{
\item{cur_row}{A data frame row (as a list or tibble row) representing the current segment. Must include relevant columns (e.g., \code{gmm_mean}, \code{gmm_weight}, \code{nonzero_count}).}

\item{next_row}{A data frame row (as a list or tibble row) representing the next segment. Must include relevant columns (e.g., \code{gmm_mean}, \code{gmm_weight}, \code{nonzero_count}).}

\item{mergeai}{Numeric. Threshold for the difference in MAF (gmm_mean) between adjacent segments to allow merging.}

\item{snpmin}{Numeric. Minimum SNP count required for a segment to be considered as a separate segment.}
}
\value{
Logical value: \code{TRUE} if the two segments should be merged, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
This function determines whether two adjacent AI (allelic imbalance) segments should be merged,
based on the difference in their GMM means and quality thresholds.
