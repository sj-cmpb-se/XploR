\title{Calculate Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) from Allelic Imbalance (LOH)}
\usage{
CcfLOH(minor, major, rho, BAF)
}
\arguments{
\item{minor}{Numeric. Minor allele copy number.}

\item{major}{Numeric. Major allele copy number.}

\item{rho}{Numeric. Tumor purity (fraction between 0 and 1).}

\item{BAF}{Numeric. Observed B-allele frequency.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The estimated cancer cell fraction (CCF), with \code{Inf} replaced by 1, \code{-Inf} and \code{NA} replaced by 0.
}
\description{
Estimates the cancer cell fraction (CCF) based on minor and major allele copy numbers, tumor purity, and observed B-allele frequency (BAF).
}
\details{
The expected BAF is calculated as \code{BAF_ex = minor / (minor + major)}.
The formula for CCF is: \cr
\code{ccf = (BAF - 0.5) / ((BAF_ex - 0.5) * rho)} \cr
If CCF is \code{Inf}, returns 1; if \code{-Inf} or \code{NA}, returns 0.
}
\examples{
CcfLOH(minor = 1, major = 2, rho = 0.7, BAF = 0.6)
