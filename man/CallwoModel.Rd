\usage{
CallwoModel(
  chromosome,
  CNF_correct,
  MAF_correct,
  MAF_gmm_G,
  MAF_Probes,
  MAF_gmm_weight,
  callcovcutoff = 0.3,
  callaicutoff = 0.3,
  minsnpcallaicutoff = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chromosome}{Character. Chromosome name (e.g., "1", "X", "Y").}

\item{CNF_correct}{Numeric. Corrected copy number fraction (CNF).}

\item{MAF_correct}{Numeric. Corrected minor allele frequency (MAF).}

\item{MAF_gmm_G}{Integer. Number of GMM clusters (not directly used in logic, but included for compatibility).}

\item{MAF_Probes}{Integer. Number of probes used for MAF estimation.}

\item{MAF_gmm_weight}{Numeric. GMM weight (not directly used in logic, but included for compatibility).}

\item{callcovcutoff}{Numeric. Threshold for CNF to call gain or loss (default: 0.3).}

\item{callaicutoff}{Numeric. Threshold for MAF to call gain with loss of heterozygosity (GAINLOH) (default: 0.3).}

\item{minsnpcallaicutoff}{Integer. Minimum number of SNP probes to call CNLOH (default: 10).}

\item{gender}{Character. Sample gender ("male" or "female").}
}
\value{
Character. Copy number call: one of "GAIN", "LOSS", "REF", "GAINLOH", or "CNLOH".
}
\description{
Assigns a copy number call ("GAIN", "LOSS", "REF", "GAINLOH", or "CNLOH") to a segment based on corrected copy number fraction (CNF), minor allele frequency (MAF), and probe characteristics, using user-defined thresholds.
}
\details{
Calls are made according to CNF and MAF thresholds:
\itemize{
\item For sex chromosomes in males, thresholds are adjusted for haploid status.
\item "GAINLOH" is called if CNF is high and MAF is below a dynamic cutoff.
\item "CNLOH" is called if MAF is low and probe count meets the minimum threshold.
}
}
\examples{
CallwoModel("1", CNF_correct = 2.8, MAF_correct = 0.1, MAF_gmm_G = 2, MAF_Probes = 15, MAF_gmm_weight = 0.5, gender = "female")
