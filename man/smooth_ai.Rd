\title{Smooth AI Bins by Window Size and Downsampling}
\usage{
smooth_ai(df, ai_binsize, gender)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or tibble. Must include columns \code{seqnames}, \code{start}, and \code{norm_af}.}

\item{ai_binsize}{Numeric. Bin size (in bases) for smoothing.}

\item{gender}{Character. Sample gender ("male" or "female"). (Currently not used in this function, but included for compatibility.)}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: \code{seqnames}, \code{bin_start}, \code{bin_end}, and smoothed AI values.
}
\description{
Smooths allelic imbalance (AI) bins by a specified window size, keeping up to 30 data points per bin using frequency-based downsampling.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Splits the data by chromosome.
\item For each bin, keeps up to 30 values using \code{\link{ai_bin_smooth}}.
}
}
\examples{
# smooth_ai(df, ai_binsize = 10000, gender = "female")

}
