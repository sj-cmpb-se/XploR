\title{Estimate Tumor Purity from Coverage and Segmentation Data}
\usage{
EstimatePurityCov(seg)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg}{A data frame or tibble of segment data, with columns: Chromosome, Segment_Mean, MAF, MAF_gmm_G, MAF_Probes, MAF_gmm_weight, size, etc.}

\item{opt}{A list of options, must include \code{gender}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
  \item{dis_df}{Data frame of model fit statistics for each purity.}
  \item{Final_model}{List with \code{Final_mu} and \code{Final_rho} (the selected purity).}
  \item{min_dis}{Minimum distance to integer copy numbers.}
  \item{seg_call}{Segment calls for the selected purity.}
  \item{Model_source}{String, always "Coverage".}
}
\description{
Estimates tumor purity by fitting coverage and BAF segmentation data across a range of purity values, selecting the purity that best matches integer copy number models.
}
\details{
This function fits models for a sequence of purity values, applies segment correction and calling, and selects the purity with the best fit to integer copy number.
}
