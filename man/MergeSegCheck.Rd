\title{Check Whether Two Segments Should Be Merged (Copy Number)}
\usage{
MergeSegCheck(cur_row, next_row, mergecov)
}
\arguments{
\item{cur_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing the current segment. Must have \code{Segment_Mean} and \code{Call}.}

\item{next_row}{A data frame row (list or tibble row) representing the next segment. Must have \code{Segment_Mean} and \code{Call}.}

\item{mergecov}{Numeric threshold for segment mean difference}
}
\value{
Logical value: \code{TRUE} if the two segments should be merged, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Determines whether two adjacent copy number segments should be merged based on the difference in their segment means
and whether their calls are identical.
}
