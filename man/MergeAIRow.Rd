\title{Merge Adjacent AI Segments Based on Similarity Criteria}
\usage{
MergeAIRow(df, opt, tmp_baf)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble of AI segments, with columns such as Chromosome, bin, Start, End, nonzero_count, each_baf, etc.}

\item{opt}{A list of options, must include \code{mergeai} (threshold for merging) and \code{snpmin} (minimum SNP count).}

\item{tmp_baf}{A data frame or tibble containing BAF values and genomic coordinates (must include Chromosome, Start, End, baf).}
}
\value{
A data frame or tibble with merged AI segments, updated BAF estimates, and segment information.
}
\description{
Iteratively merges adjacent rows in a data frame of AI segments if they meet criteria defined by \code{MergeAICheck}.
For merged segments, BAF values are re-estimated and segment information is updated.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link{MergeAICheck}} to determine if two adjacent segments should be merged.
For merged segments, BAF values are re-estimated using \code{\link{EstimateBAFbyGMM}}.
}
