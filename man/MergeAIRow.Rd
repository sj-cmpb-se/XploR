\title{Merge Adjacent AI Segments Based on Similarity Criteria}
\usage{
MergeAIRow(df, mergeai, snpmin, tmp_maf)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble of AI segments, with columns such as Chromosome, bin, Start, End, snp_count, each_maf, etc.}

\item{mergeai}{Numeric. Threshold for the difference in MAF (gmm_mean) between adjacent segments to allow merging.}

\item{snpmin}{Numeric. Minimum SNP count required for a segment to be considered as a separate segment.}

\item{tmp_maf}{A data frame or tibble containing maf values and genomic coordinates (must include Chromosome, Start, End, maf).}
}
\value{
A data frame or tibble with merged AI segments, updated maf estimates, and segment information.
}
\description{
Iteratively merges adjacent rows in a data frame of AI segments if they meet criteria defined by \code{MergeAICheck}.
For merged segments, MAF values are re-estimated and segment information is updated.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link{MergeAICheck}} to determine if two adjacent segments should be merged.
For merged segments, maf values are re-estimated using \code{\link{EstimateMAFbyGMM}}.
}
