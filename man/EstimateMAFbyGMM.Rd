\title{Estimate MAF Cluster Mean and Weight Using Gaussian Mixture Modeling}
\usage{
EstimateMAFbyGMM(maf_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{maf_values}{Numeric vector of MAF values.}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector with elements:
\item{gmm_mean}{The mean of the most prominent cluster (capped at 0.5).}
\item{gmm_weight}{The mixture weight of the most prominent cluster.}
\item{gmm_G}{Number of clusters after merging adjacent means.}
}
\description{
Fits a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to Minor allele frequency (MAF) values and returns the most prominent cluster's mean and weight.
Clusters with similar means (within a threshold) are merged. If there are insufficient values or nearly no variance, a simple mean is returned.
}
\details{
Uses \code{\link[mclust]{Mclust}} for Gaussian mixture modeling.
