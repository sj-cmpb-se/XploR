\title{Group Values by Change Points in the Mean}
\usage{
Groupvalues(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the same length as \code{x}, where each element indicates the group assignment based on detected change points.
}
\description{
Uses the \code{changepoint} package to detect change points in the mean of a numeric vector and assigns group IDs accordingly.
}
\details{
Uses \code{cpt.mean} from the \pkg{changepoint} package with the PELT method and MBIC penalty to detect change points in the mean.
}
\examples{
# Example with a simulated change in mean
set.seed(123)
x <- c(rnorm(50, 0), rnorm(50, 3))
group_id <- Groupvalues(x)
table(group_id)

}
